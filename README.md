This repository contains a Python code example illustrating the handling of uncommon errors such as `TypeError` (incompatible data types in an operation) and `ZeroDivisionError` (division by zero).  The code includes a function that attempts to perform division and utilizes a `try-except` block to gracefully handle potential issues, providing informative error messages to the user. This is crucial for robust and user-friendly program design.
